# Loan Calculator

This amortization schedule calculator creates a payment schedule for a loan with equal loan payments 
for the life of a loan. The amortization table shows how each payment is applied to the principal 
balance and the interest owed.

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to start a service on your local machine.

For a quick start, it could be done by running either of these 2 scripts:

```shell
./start-loan-calculator-with-mysql.sh
```
or
```shell
./start-loan-calculator-with-postgres.sh
```

In both scenarios, they will build fresh new docker image of loan calculator application and run it 
with corresponding database. The only difference is which database will be used, MySQL or PostgreSql.

Starting a service could also be done by executing the `main` method in the
`com.leanpay.loancalculator.LoanCalculatorApplication` class from IDE or running Gradle plugin
command:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

In this case, H2 in-memory database will be used.

## Installation and Build

### Project download

Downloading Loan Calculator Spring Boot project on local machine can be done by executing command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/marko-domic/loan-calculator.git
```

### Project build

Whole project was developed by [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/). Building and testing it is
done with the help of the same tool, by executing command:

```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

This command will trigger project build, all unit and integration tests of the project, which are required steps in building phase.

### Database setup

By default, Loan Calculator uses embedded
[H2 in-memory database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). Changing it could be done in 2 ways:

1. By defining `DB_URL` environment variable
2. By setting `spring.datasource.url` spring configuration

Similar, DB user credentials can be set also in 2 ways:

1. By defining `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables
2. By setting `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` spring configurations

Service is relying on relational databases only, which can be:

* [H2 in-memory database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

If PostgreSQL database is used, it is required to set another property for Flyway database
migrations, because of its different SQL syntax. It could be done in one of these 2 ways:

1. By setting `FLYWAY_LOCATIONS` environment variable to `classpath:postgresql/db/migration`
   (`FLYWAY_LOCATIONS=classpath:postgresql/db/migration`)
2. By setting `spring.flyway.locations` spring configuration to `classpath:postgresql/db/migration`

### Build Docker image

Creating Docker image of a service can be done by executing command:

```shell
./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=loan-calculator
```
